# Note
This is a fork of FIX94's triforce-nand-iso-extract that extracts an ISO out of the Japanese Mario Kart Arcade GP 1 MAME files. 

# Usage
Grab the [TriNandIsoExtractGP1.exe](bin/TriNandIsoExtractGP1.exe?raw=true) and place it into a new folder.  
Copy the .bin files of mkartagp into that folder as well.  
Run TriNandIsoExtract and wait for it to create a OUT.BIN.  
Rename that OUT.BIN to for example game.iso, it is now ready to play.  

NOTE: this revision of the game is currently unsupported on Nintendont.
