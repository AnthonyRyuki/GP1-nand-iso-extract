# Note
This is a fork of FIX94's triforce-nand-iso-extract that extracts an ISO out of MAME's Triforce NAND files.

# Usage
Grab the [TriNandIsoExtract.exe](bin/TriNandIsoExtract.exe?raw=true) and place it into a new folder.  
Copy the .bin files of mkartagp into that folder as well.  
Run TriNandIsoExtract and wait for it to create a OUT.BIN.  
Rename that OUT.BIN to for example game.iso, it is now ready to play.  

NOTE: MAME currently has bad dumps for Mario Kart Arcade GP, so for now it only makes sense to use this application for F-Zero AX Monster Ride.
