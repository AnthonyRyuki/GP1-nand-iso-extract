# Note
As of right now only mkartag2 from MAME can be extracted with this tool, others may follow some time in the future.  
mkartag2 is the japanese version of mario kart arcade gp2.  

# Usage
Grab the [TriNandIsoExtract.exe](bin/TriNandIsoExtract.exe?raw=true) and place it into a new folder.  
Copy the .bin files of mkartag2 as well as the US version of mario kart arcade gp2 with the name MARIOKARTGP2.BIN into that folder as well.  
Run TriNandIsoExtract and wait for it to create a OUT.BIN.  
Rename that OUT.BIN to for example game.iso, it is now ready to play.  
That game should have the following checksum:  
MD5: 87118694af6a90a7634b2b11cdaddb33  
SHA-1 [160]: 4cb3a3e825682f495fd0d6540829eb63dd0025f1  
CRC32: 8038e555
